# Q2: Differences Between Arrays and Linked Lists

When comparing arrays and linked lists, the differences mainly lie in how they allocate memory, their performance characteristics, and how they handle insertion and deletion operations.

# 1. Memory Allocation

Arrays:
> Uses a fixed block of memory (contiguous).

Linked Lists:
> Uses separate memory blocks (non-contiguous).
# 2. Performance

Arrays:
> Accessing an element by index is very fast (O(1)).

Linked Lists:
> Accessing an element requires traversal, which is slower (O(n)).

# 3. Insertion and Deletion Operations

Arrays:
> Insertion: Inserting in the middle or beginning requires shifting elements (O(n)).

> Deletion: Deleting an element requires shifting elements (O(n)).

> These operations are less efficient compared to linked lists when frequent modifications are required.

Linked Lists:
> Insertion: Inserting at the beginning is fast (O(1)), but inserting in the middle is slower (O(n)).

> Deletion:Deleting from the beginning is fast (O(1)), but deleting a specific node is slower (O(n)).
